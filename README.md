### Introduction to Dataset
My dataset is on the paintings of Bob Ross and is available from the [Tidy Tuesday GitHub site](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-02-21). This dataset was created by Jared Wilber and contains observations about 403 paintings created over 31 seasons of Bob Rossâ€™s show The Joy of Painting including painting titles, what episode they were created in, and what colors and combinations of colors were used in each painting.


### Questions:

What is the general distribution of number of colors used in a Bob Ross painting?

Does the average number of colors used vary across seasons of the show?

What color scheme did Bob use in any given episode?

Does Bob have favorite colors?
